# Movies-ETL
## Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. We needed to help Britta create an automated pipline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
 
## Summary
Refactoring code from the module was necessary to create a function that takes in three files and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
